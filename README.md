# FQI-Project
Quantum Computation using Qiskit

This project repository contains the code associated with a 
project in the course Fundamentals of Quantum Information at 
TU Delft in the Netherlands. The code found in the folder 
[Circuits](https://github.com/nicholaszutt/FQI-Project/tree/master/Circuits) 
implements the Teleportation, Entanglement Swapping, 
Entanglement Purification and Grover Algorithm protocols 
on IBM Quantum Experience backends. Communication with the 
backends is done using Qiskit, an open-source quantum 
computing software development platform.
