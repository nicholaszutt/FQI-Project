  abstract =     {Superconducting qubits are leading candidates in the race to
                  build a quantum computer capable of realizing computations
                  beyond the reach of modern supercomputers. The superconducting
                  qubit modality has been used to demonstrate prototype
                  algorithms in the 'noisy intermediate scale quantum' (NISQ)
                  technology era, in which non-error-corrected qubits are used
                  to implement quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. With
                  the recent demonstrations of multiple high fidelity two-qubit
                  gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible
                  superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds
                  promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale
                  error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we
                  discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit
                  hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early
                  NISQ algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction
                  using superconducting qubits. While continued work on many
                  aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of
                  both conceptual and technical progress in the last years has
                  been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement
                  stemming from this progress.},
