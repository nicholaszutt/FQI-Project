\section{Theory}
In a classical computer its internal state is measured at different points in time in order to debug the system. However, for a quantum computer, the analogy would be the measurement of its density matrix, which is called state tomography. We first define the density matrix of a single qubit:
\begin{equation}
\rho=\frac{1}{2}\left(I+\sum_i\alpha_i\sigma_i\right)
\end{equation}
