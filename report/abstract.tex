\begin{abstract}
  \noindent The IBM Quantum Experience is a public platform for executing
  quantum circuits on superconducting back-ends. We execute the Teleportation
  protocol, Grover's search algorithm, Entanglement Swapping and Entanglement
  Purification on three superconducting devices available from IBMQ. We analyze
  the results from post measurement circuits and reconstruct the final quantum state using state tomography.
