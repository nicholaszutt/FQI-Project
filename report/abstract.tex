  \noindent The IBM Quantum Experience is a public platform for executing
quantum circuits on superconducting back-ends. We execute the Teleportation
protocol, Entanglement Swapping, Entanglement Purification and Grover's
Algorithm on three superconducting devices available from IBMQ. We present the
results using the appropriate post-measurement selection techniques and
reconstruct the output states through state tomography. We analyze the
performance of the three devices and put forth an explanation for the
discrepancies in the results between the three devices.
