  \noindent The IBM Quantum Experience is a public platform for executing
  quantum circuits on superconducting back-ends. We execute the Teleportation
  protocol, Grover's search algorithm, Entanglement Swapping and Entanglement
  Purification on three superconducting devices available from IBMQ. We present
  the results using the appropriate post-measurement selection techniques and
  reconstruct the output states using state tomography. We analyze the
  performance of the three devices and put forth an explanation for the
  discrepancies in the results between the three devices.
