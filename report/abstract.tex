\begin{abstract}
  \noindent The IBM Quantum Experience is a public platform for executing
  quantum circuits on superconducting back-ends. We execute the Teleportation
  protocol, Grover's search algorithm, Entanglement Swapping and Entanglement
  Purification on three superconducting devices available from IBMQ. We analyze
  the results and DO MORE COOL STUFF.
