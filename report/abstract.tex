  \noindent The IBM Quantum Experience is a public platform for executing
quantum circuits on superconducting back-ends. Using Qiskit, an open-source
quantum computing platform, we execute the Teleportation protocol, Entanglement
Swapping, Entanglement Purification and Grover's Algorithm on three
superconducting devices available from IBMQ. We employ the appropriate
post-measurement schemes to circumvent the inability to apply gates after
measuring some but not all qubits of a circuit, and present the output,
reconstructed using quantum state tomography. We analyze the resulting
performance, largely through taking the fidelity between the output and the
desired or expected result, and put forth an explanation for the discrepancies
in the results between the three devices.
