\section{Conclusion}

Our research project was mainly focused on the fidelities of different circuits and if we were able to improve those for readout error using state tomography on various circuits. We conclude that we succeeded in recreating the final states using the post measurement method (except for the Grover circuit), since the simulator fidelities for the four circuits are approximately 1. The noisy simulator overestimated the device results for each circuit, and the error correction methods for one- and two-qubit systems improve the fidelity with respect to the device. The optimal backend for executing the relevant circuits is Yorktown, because it gives the best fidelity and the Pauli sets
