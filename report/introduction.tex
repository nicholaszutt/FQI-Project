\section{Introduction}

\lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{C} omputer simulations have arisen as powerful
tools for investigating the molecular dynamics of systems composed of
many particles. This report simulates the noble gas Argon at various temperatures
and densities, probing the three states of matter, and investigates a set of
macroscopic observables, the specific heat, pressure, pair correlation function
and diffusion constants of the system. \cite{nielsen10_quant}

In order to simulate a system of particles accurately, the first step is to
choose an appropriate potential with which to model the inter-atomic forces
exchanged between the particles in motion. We use a mathematically simple model
that has been popular historically due to its computational efficiency and which
has the added benefit of being especially accurate for noble gases. It assumes
dipole-dipole interaction between neutral atoms, and includes a repulsive term
for short distances. This is the Lennard-Jones potential, which has the form
