\section{Quantum Circuits}
For this research we have chosen to execute the Teleportation protocol, Grover's search algorithm, Entanglement Swapping and Entanglement Purification on the devices. The circuits are all made using an open source software development kit called Qiskit, which uses Python as its main programming language. The written codes, made with Jupyter Notebook, for the circuits can be found in appendix {\color{red} \emph{number}}. In the following we will describe the circuits, mainly focussing on ... and {\color{red}\emph{the measurement of the circuits}}. Thereafter, the measurement protocols will be described.

\subsection{The Teleportation protocol}
Quantum teleportation is a procedure where a quantum state can be transmitted from one location to the other. Usually this is done by creating an arbitrary state $\ket{\psi}$ on the first qubit and a $\ket{\Phi^+}$ Bell-state on the second and third qubit, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:telgen}.
\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{General teleportation protocol circuit. Here the $\ket{\Phi^+}$ Bell-state is denoted as $\ket{\beta_{00}}$.  \cite{nielsen10_quant}}
	\label{fig:telgen}
\end{figure}
Subsequently, a CNOT gate is applied to the second qubit and a Hadamard gate to the first qubit. Now the first and second qubit will be measured in the Z-basis, with the measurement results being $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively. A X- and/or Z-gate is applied to the third qubit depending on the measurement outcome. If $M_1 = +1$ a Z-gate will be applied and if $M_2 = +1$ a X-gate will be applied. This will result in the state $\ket{\psi}$ being teleported to the third qubit.

However, to know if the state $\ket{\psi}$ is properly transported, the third qubit must be measured. Unfortunately, it is not possible (yet) to apply a gate after a measurement on the used devices. So, we will have to resort to post measurement techniques, as the gates cannot be applied to the third qubit. The circuit that is send to the devices is presented in figure \ref{fig:telcir}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/teleport_circuit.png}
	\caption{Teleport circuit used for the measurements. (The operators on the first qubit were randomized every run.)}
	\label{fig:telcir}
\end{figure}
As one can easily see the gates on the third qubit are absent. To account for this, a Pauli-X or Pauli-Z matrix is applied to the final state on the third qubit, after the measurement. Which works similar to the general protocol: if $M_1 = +1$ a Pauli-Z matrix will be applied and if $M_2 = +1$ a Pauli-X matrix will be applied. This will, in post measurement, result in the state $\ket{\psi}$ being teleported to the third qubit.

\subsection{Grover's search algorithm}
The Grover search algorithm can find an input given to a black box with a high likeliness. In our case, the input that is given is a unitary 4x4 diagonal matrix, with three values being +1 and one being -1. The algorithm can find which one of the numbers on the diagonal is -1. The circuit that is used in the measurements is presented in figure \ref{fig:grocir}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/grover_circuit.png}
	\caption{Grover's search algorithm circuit used for the measurements. (The position of the -1 value is randomized every run.)}
	\label{fig:grocir}
\end{figure}
For explanatory reasons, let us choose the unitary matrix to be:
\begin{equation*}
U = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*} 
$U$ is randomized for every run of the circuit on a device or simulator. The two qubit will both start in the $\ket{0}$ state. After the application of the Hadamard gates the total state will be: $\ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\ket{00}+\ket{01}+\ket{10}+\ket{11}\right)$. Now $U$ is applied giving: $\ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\ket{00}+\ket{01}+\ket{10}-\ket{11}\right)$.
The part after the unitary in figure \ref{fig:grocir} is important for the Grover's search algorithm and does an inversion about the mean. This inverts the constants multiplied with each state around the mean of the total. In this case the mean is $\frac{3\cdot\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}}{4} = \frac{1}{4}$. Inverting $\frac{1}{2}$ about the mean, means that it will become 0. For $-\frac{1}{2}$ it will become 1, thus making $\ket{11}$ the only state left. Measuring this will result in $M_1 = M_2 = +1$. This result is related to where in $U$ the -1 value is positioned and in this case the result shows it is in the bottom right corner (where we positioned -1 in the first place).
